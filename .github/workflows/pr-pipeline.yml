# This workflow will build a docker container, publish it to IBM Container Registry, and deploy it to IKS when there is a push to the "main" branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Ensure that your repository contains a Dockerfile
# 2. Setup secrets in your repository by going to settings: Create ICR_NAMESPACE and IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY
# 3. Change the values for the IBM_CLOUD_REGION, REGISTRY_HOSTNAME, IMAGE_NAME, IKS_CLUSTER, DEPLOYMENT_NAME, and PORT
